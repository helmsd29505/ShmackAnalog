Analog Watchface for FitBit Versa with stats and weather

This is my first public attempt at a watch face for the FitBit Versa. The watch features an analog and digital clock. It also list the current steps, heart rate, date, battery charge, and weather.

I'd like to thank Ozibyte for his analog how to. This is what got me started. I'd also like to thank TranquilMarmot (Nate) for your help on the messaging and weather. None of this would of been posible without these contributions.

This readme and project is a work in progress. I will try my best to give credit to all that deserve it and help any that require.
